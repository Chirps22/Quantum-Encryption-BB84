# Quantum Encryption (BB84)

This project implements the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using Qiskit. It demonstrates how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely generate a shared secret key using quantum mechanics principles, while detecting potential eavesdropping.

Currently, the project simulates the protocol and prints key details in the console. It’s designed as a foundation for exploring quantum cryptography, error detection, and secure communications.

## Features
- Quantum Circuit Simulation: Uses Qiskit and AerSimulator to simulate qubits transmitted between Alice and Bob.
- Random Basis Selection: Alice and Bob independently choose random bases for encoding and measurement.
- Key Sifting: Shared key generated by comparing bases and discarding mismatched measurements.
- Console Output: Displays Alice’s bits and bases, Bob’s measurement results, and the final shared key.

## Next
- Use Matplotlib to graph the effect of eavesdropping on key security.
- Allow users to run simulations with custom key lengths and optional Eve interference.
