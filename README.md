# Quantum Encryption (BB84)

This project demonstrates a simplified simulation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using Qiskit.  

## Overview
This project simulates:

- Alice generating random bits and bases.
- Encoding those bits into qubits according to the bases.  
- Bob measuring the qubits in random bases of his own.  
- Alice and Bob comparing their bases to create a shared secret key.  

## Next
- Simulate a third-party observer measuring transmitted qubits to demonstrate how BB84 detects interference and information leakage.
- Develop Python-based visualisations to show qubit states, measurement bases, and key agreement probabilities.
