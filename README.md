# Quantum Encryption (BB84 Protocol)

This project demonstrates a simplified simulation of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol using Qiskit.  

## Overview
This project simulates:

1. Alice generating random bits and bases.  
2. Encoding those bits into qubits according to the bases.  
3. Bob measuring the qubits in random bases of his own.  
4. Alice and Bob comparing their bases to create a shared secret key.
